Since then, I have focused on expanding my skill set in JavaScript, particularly with technologies like React and Next.js, as well as backend technologies such as PHP and Full-Stack development. 

      In January 2024, I began my professional web development career with an internship that quickly transitioned into a full-time role. During this time, I contributed to over 40 WordPress websites and e-commerce platforms, where I gained significant experience in PHP, JavaScript, and WordPress hooks. I also worked on custom web development solutions, focusing on JavaScript fullstack development. Currently, I’m continuing my learning through the IBM Full-Stack JavaScript course to enhance my backend expertise and broaden my skill set.`,
